## ‚ú® Key Features

This application can simulate the following:

-   üîë **Symmetric Encryption & Decryption:**
    -   **Caesar Cipher**: The simplest classical substitution cipher.
    -   **Vigenere Cipher**: A more secure version of the Caesar Cipher using a keyword.
    -   **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A modern and highly secure encryption standard used worldwide.
-   üîê **Asymmetric Encryption & Decryption:**
    -   **RSA (Rivest‚ÄìShamir‚ÄìAdleman)**: A public-key algorithm that is the foundation for many modern security systems.
-   #Ô∏è‚É£ **Hashing Function:**
    -   **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)**: Generates a unique 256-bit hash from any given data.
-   üñ•Ô∏è **Interactive Interface**: Input your text, choose an algorithm, and see the results instantly.

## üí° Future Development

Some ideas for future enhancements:

-   [ ] Add more cryptography algorithms (e.g., DES, Triple DES, Blowfish).
-   [ ] Implement a step-by-step visualization of the encryption/decryption process.
-   [ ] Improve the UI/UX for a more modern and responsive design.
-   [ ] Add a feature to encrypt/decrypt entire files.
